        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I already said that I wanted to add my favorite foods here, but I'd also like to add those that are simple as well. Well, it doesn't get much more simple and delicious than the venerable grilled cheese. Bread, butter, cheese - that's about it. You can fancy it up with different breads and cheeses or add other ingredients, but the tried and true classic is one of my all-time favorites. </p>
        <p>While this recipe from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23891/grilled-cheese-sandwich/">allrecipes.com</a> uses cheddar cheese, you can use just about whatever kind of cheese you want (or whatever kind of cheese you have on hand). I'm a big fan of cheddar, Colby jack, or plain ol' American cheese for my grilled cheeses.</p>
