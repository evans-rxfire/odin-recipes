            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For this project I want to use recipes for my favorite foods. My favorite all-time cookie is the classic peanut butter cookie. Simple ingredients, easy to make, and very delicious. </p>
            <p>I metioned that these are easy to make - but there are some tips and tricks to make them better. We always chill the dough after mixing to make it a little easier to work with and make into balls. Also, using a fork to make the quintessential criss-cross pattern somehow makes them taste even better. The original recipe can be found at <a class="ar-link" href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/10275/classic-peanut-butter-cookies/">allrecipes.com</a></p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs.</li>
                <li>Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour to make it easier to work with.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
