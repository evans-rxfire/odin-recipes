            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Last but certainly not least is one of my favorite and simple main dishes: meatloaf. There are a myriad of variations of meatloaf (one I truly enjoy is made with ground venison), but we are sticking with the classics here.  </p>
            <p>While this recipe from <a class="ar-link" href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/219171/classic-meatloaf/">allrecipes.com</a> might not be as short and simple as the others on this page, it's still easy to make and the one I found that most closely resembles the meatloaf recipe used by my family at least once a month. Enjoy!</p>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="ingredients">Glaze Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha, or to taste</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil.</li>
                <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until very finely chopped, almost to a pur√©e. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon until ingredients are just combined. Sprinkle in bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix.</li>
                <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
                <li>Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then pull a tiny bit glaze down the sides.</li>
                <li>Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that temperature. Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
